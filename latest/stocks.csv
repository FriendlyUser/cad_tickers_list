(TSX: SXGC) (ASX: SX2) (OTCQX: SXGCF), controls the Sunday Creek Gold-Antimony Project located 60 km north of Melbourne, Australia. Sunday Creek has emerged as one of the Western world's most significant gold and antimony discoveries, with exceptional drilling results. The mineralization follows a 'Golden Ladder' structure over 1.2 km of strike length, with confirmed continuity from surface to 1,100 m depth. Sunday Creek's strategic value is enhanced by its dual-metal profile, with antimony contributing approximately 20% of the in-situ value alongside gold. Importantly, Sunday Creek can be developed primarily based on gold economics, which reduces antimony-related risks while maintaining strategic supply potential. This has gained increased significance following China's export restrictions on antimony, a critical metal for defence and semiconductor applications.",https://www.southerncrossgold.com,,+1 604 685-9316,"1090 West Georgia Street,Suite 1305, Vancouver, BC, CA",8,258954148,0.01,258504148,0.0,10.6938511,,10.92,2.8,0.049429,550285,569379,476912,11.19,-637.8,-5.29,-4.86,8.425714,7.8486,6.16955,,,equity,Company
