Through its research, Satellos has developed SAT-3247, a first-of-its-kind, orally administered small molecule drug designed to address deficits in muscle repair and regeneration. SAT-3247 targets AAK1, a key protein that Satellos has identified as capable of replacing the signal normally provided by dystrophin in muscle stem cells to effect repair and regeneration. By restoring this missing dystrophin signal in DMD, SAT-3247 enables muscle stem cells to divide properly and more efficiently, promoting natural muscle repair and regeneration.",https://www.satellos.com,ir@satellos.com,+1 905 336-6128,"Royal Bank Plaza,South Tower,200 Bay St., Toronto, Ontario, CA",14,185507153,0,185507153,,0.656582278,,0.94,0.52,0.000785,207134,177859,149720,3.6,-7.4,-86.75,-76.73,0.68,0.7128,0.6671,,,equity,Company
