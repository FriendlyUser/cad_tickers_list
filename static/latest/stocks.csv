Our flagship project, Thundercloud, is located in the Manitou-Stormy Lakes Greenstone Belt in Ontario, Canada, hosting a NI 43-101 open-pit resource. In Nevada, the Golden Repeat property is at Midas region of Elko County. In just two years, Dynasty has increased Thundercloud's resource from 187,000 oz to 439,000 oz at 2.14 g/t, with impressive high-grade intercepts like 246 g/t over 1.5 meters and 8.4 g/t over 73.5 meters, alongside long low-grade zones of 1.0 g/t over 163 meters. We aim to define a multi-million-ounce bulk-tonnage resource with high-grade intervals to optimize production costs. Over 90 percent of Thundercloud remains undrilled, offering significant resource expansion potential. Led by seasoned geologists, we are committed to growing shareholder value through strategic drilling, resource expansion, and acquisition of high-quality assets.",https://www.dynastygoldcorp.com,info@dynastygoldcorp.com,+1 604 633-2100,"610 Granville Street,Suite 1613, Vancouver, BC, CA",0,61524411,0,61124411,0.0,0.13,,0.28,0.1,0.024119,38306,36536,41901,1.4,-69.7,-3.94,-3.82,0.129524,0.1348,0.143675,,,equity,Company
