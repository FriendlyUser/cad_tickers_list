At present, spodumene concentrate is at a record high price of US$5,500/tonne and forecast to go higher. Li3 Lithium has acquired its first lithium project in Zimbabwe and is evaluating additional acquisition opportunities in Africa. In Argentina, the Company' is leveraging the success of the founders' previous TSX Venture-listed Argentine lithium brine company (LSC Lithium Corporation) that was sold in 2019 for $100+ million.
